The zip (charter-demo.zip) is the roku channel that can be "side-loaded" onto a developer-mode enabled roku.
It includes a custom video player with transparent overlay and navigable control menus.

All source code for the channel is included in the 'channel' folder, 'source/main.brs' file. 
The channel uses the m3u8 video stream provided with the assignment and called through the 'json/feed.json' file.
